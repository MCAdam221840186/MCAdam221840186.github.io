<p style="font-size: 18px; font-family: 'Georgia', serif;">
  I'm currently a third year undergraduate student at 
  [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) 
  in Nanjing University. Now I am a research intern in 
  [Theory Group](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/) 
  and fortunate to be advised by Prof.
  [LingXiao Huang](https://sites.google.com/site/lingxiaohuang1990).
</p>

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, especially in the use of data compression for machine learning and combinatorial optimization problems.
