I'm currently a third year undergraduate student at [School of Computer Science](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) in [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/). Now I am a research intern in [Theory Group](https://tcs.nju.edu.cn/) and fortunate to be advised by [Prof.LingXiao Huang](https://sites.google.com/site/lingxiaohuang1990).

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, especially in the use of data compression for machine learning and combinatorial optimization problems.
